--------------------
You enter the room, it feel's hot and humid.

A faint blue glowing light, emerging from stones and crystals, shine and brighten the room.
Allowing you to see its contents.

You see scattered bones.
Remains of heroes long since fallen.

Because of the faint light, you can hardly see the paths in the distance.

In front of you, to the south you see a passage surrounded by
broken down stone. Two knights holding spears sit on either side of the entryway.
A hot wind emerges from its eerie dark entry.

To the west, another path with an open metal door.
A faint light comes from within it.
