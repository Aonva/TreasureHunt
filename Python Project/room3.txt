--------------------
You emerge into a room with glorious patterns of floral tile on the floor.

The room is lined with statues.

Even though the statues are broken and somewhat deformed
they still seem to hold a glorious beauty to them.

The vines and moss seemed to cloak them as if it were clothing.

The windows filled with broken stained glass allowing shimmers of
light in various colors to reflect into the room and light your path.

To the south you see a pathway.

There seems to be a no other way to exit the room other than going south or
returning the way you came.
