--------------------
Cutting your way through the greenery and overgrown vines.

You emerge into a room filled with the most amazing colors of forest you've ever seen.
Species of plants never even heard of fill the room with the aroma of fresh honey fragrances.

On the floor you see small puddles of water from the rain seeping through the cracks of the broken ceiling.
Roots from the trees above hanging from above as if reaching for the water below.

Mesmerized by such beauty, you do not see where you are stepping and fall into a hole.

Everything suddenly goes black.......
