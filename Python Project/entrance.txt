--------------------
You approach The ruins of a destroyed Castle embedded into the side of a mountain.
Hidden deep within the forest.

The entrance guarded by stone armored knights. Broken down by the plant life surrounding it.
You move south, immersing yourself into the entrance of a shadowy hall surrounded with stone debris.
You can see a remanence of what looked like stone column's now overgrown with lush greenery.

Walking further you emerge into a small room.

When your eyes adjust to the lighting you see around you destroyed pillars and architecture
from what appears to be an ancient civilization long deceased.

Forgotten by time......
....

To the West you see a passageway overgrown with vines and moss.
But appears to still have some way to enter.

To the south you see an archway which seems to lead into another room that looks dark and eerie.

To the East you see a hallway with two stone night's on either side of the arched entryway.
A cool breeze feels to emerge from it.
