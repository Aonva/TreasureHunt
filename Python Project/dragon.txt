--------------------
You pass through the entryway with the knights holding spears.
You emerge into the room and look around.

You see the stone pillars holding up the ceiling, which seems to go on forever.
The walls are lined with hieroglyphs and statues now decayed from time.

The room feels hot, heavy, and humid.
The ground beneath you, broken stones and tile scattered around the room.

You continue to walk forward and up ahead are stone steps that lead to a throne.
Behind the throne you seem to notice that in the far left corner of the room, the walls are destroyed.
As if something burrowed and tunneled through it.

....

Suddenly the ground begins to tremble. Large screeches and roars
emerge from the dark hole.

Suddenly the creature emerges from the dust and debris.
Its shadowy outline sends shivers down your spine.

A creature so foul, it was thought to only be in fairy tales, emerges in front of you.

The Dragon, with its hot steamy breath pouring onto you and it's scales shifting with anger.
He lunges forward with one swift bite and swallows you whole!

No need to chew!!
