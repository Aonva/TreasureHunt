You enter the room, you see that the floral tile pattern continues
on into this room along with the broken stained-glass windows
and overgrown plant life.

In the corner you see a broken down altar.

Within the large altar there is a statute of the beautiful woman with
angelic wings clothed in garments, resembling that of your
priests within your temples.

The stained-glass windows surround the altar letting in shimmers of life
from the world above.

Next to the altar there is another passageway to your south.
This path seems to go deeper into the cavern.
Hot wind emerges from its eerie dark entry.

To the West there is another hall.
On ether side of the entryway there are two stone knights.
