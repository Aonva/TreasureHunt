You enter the room and see it scattered with bones.

Remains of heroes long since fallen.

The room is lit by a faint light of the blue crystals you saw in the last room.
You can hardly see the paths in the distance.

To the north, you see a path covered in vines and overgrown plant life.

To the south, you see a path lined with the glowing cristal's.
