--------------------
You enter the room and see destroyed stones and pillars.
The room is hot and humid.

The floor looks unstable and there are large holes and gaps throughout the room.
The gaps seem to lead into the abyss and the holes spew off hot steam.

You begin to step forward.

Suddenly the ground begins to shake!!!

The ground crumbles and breaks beneath you.
You begin to fall into a dark hole.

It suddenly goes dark........
