Now that the creature is gone you see the room has stone floors and walls.

Along the walls are shelving that looked to hold objects at one time.

It appeared to be a dinning hall of some sort, with
broken tables and decayed rotting food scattered through out the room.

No doubt left by the creature that was here.

On the other side of the room, to the south, there is a wooden door.

There seems to be a no other way to exit the room other than going south or
returning the way you came.
