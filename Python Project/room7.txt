Now that you can see the room.

Two very large statues appear to be welcoming you into this corridor.

Beyond them pillars carved as people appearing to hold up the ceiling from falling in on you.

This grand hall is decorated with hieroglyphs and unknown markings.

The floor, made of marble, glittering from the reflection of the light of the blue crystals throughout the room.

You see more bones and remains. Unable to make out whether there was a creature or human.

Scattered throughout the room are fallen debris of stones and statues.

To the south of the long corridor, in front of you, there is a large metal door.

To the east of the room, another Metal door that is open, a faint light glows from it.
