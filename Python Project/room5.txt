--------------------
You pass through the entryway guarded by the stone knights.

You enter the next room.

A faint blue glowing light emerging from the stones and crystals, shines and brighten the room.
Allowing you to see its contents.

Before you there is a fountain flowing with mountain spring water.
It's water sounds flowing echo throughout the room.
Giving a peaceful and calming atmosphere.

It appears that this was some sort of garden courtyard,
now taken over by nature.

In front of you to the West you see another passage surrounded
by plain, broken down stone and plants.

To the South another plain path.
