You push open the metal door with all your strength.

Upon entering into the cavern, you are blinded by the blue light glowing from the crystals within the room.

Your eye's adjust and glittering within inches in front of you are mountains of
gold and treasure chests filled with rubies.

Lining the walls of the cavern are statues of knights standing guard with golden armor, shields, and swords.

At the center of the cavern with a faint glowing aura....

The statue of the goddess stands tall with arms wide open welcoming you.
As if offering her riches in return for your hard work in finding her.

At the feet of the goddess statue, within a stone, held a staff.
Merlin's staff!!

Behind the goddess lies the mountain spring.

The river leads to the outside. A small boat is chained to the dock.
Leading you back to the outside world.
